We create a project on Interactive Virtual Drawing Board Using OpenCV and Python.
First Process of our Project it is neccessary to install all libraries successfully that have used in project.
All libra. are mentioned below:
import cv2             # opencv
import numpy as np
import mediapipe as mp
from collections import deque
import os
import pyautogui
import speech_recognition as sr
import datetime
import threading
import time
import  keyboard
After the succefully installation of all libraries, our project is ready to run.
Next step is recognising the speech/voice. Just say screenshot then system automatically recognised the voice and take screenshot and save in our PC/Laptop. You want to create new folder and set the path to save the screenshot.
(Only Screenshot Command is detectable).
Finally our project running or execution proccess is done. After the successfully execution you can draw virtually some possible things like ABCD,1234.lines.
This project is perfectally useful for children for the education purpose.
